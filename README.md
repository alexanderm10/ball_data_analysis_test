# ball_data_analysis_test

In this repository you will find all of the materials asked for durinng the Ball Helix Bioinformatics Associate Scientist Coding Challenge.

## Prompt Files:
test_gene_expression_matrix.txt--initial data frame to be analyzed
Ball_Associate_Bioinfo_Sci_Coding_Challenge.pdf--PDF containing Prompt

## Submission files:
ball_analyst_test_writeup_textonly.txt--text only file containing answers to tasks 1, 2, and 3 in the Ball_Associate_Bioinfo_Sci_Coding_Challenge.pdf
Ball__Analyst_Test_markdown.pdf-- Markdown file showing R-code generated in answering the Ball_Associate_Bioinfo_Sci_Coding_Challenge.pdf prompts. Code is annotated with thought process during analyses.
gene_onoff.png--figure generated to show the genes of interest in prompt 2 of Ball_Associate_Bioinfo_Sci_Coding_Challenge.pdf

## r_files
All files used and generated during the analysis period

### figures--folder where preliminary figures are housed
- gene_onoff.png
- manhattan_test.png
- ratio_manhattan_test.png

### input_data--folder where original input matrix is housed
- test_gene_expression_matrix.txt

### processed_data-folder where produced data products are housed 
- sig_genes.csv--list of genes to be investigated further (99 up regulated; 108 downregulated)




- 1_data_walkthrough.R--file produced for preliminary data walkthrough; ignore this file.
- 2_genetics_example_trial.R--containts scripts and code for conducting the analyses populating the markdown file. Includes ordination, significance test for up and down regulation of genes, and code identifying which genes might be the best candidates for further analysis

- Ball_analyst_test_writeup.Rmd--code used to prodce the Ball__Analyst_Test_markdown.pdf
